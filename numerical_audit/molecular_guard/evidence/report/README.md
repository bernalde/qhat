# Fixed LiH finite-step interval certificate

All132circuits,11reference evolutions and66fixed schedule comparisons are retained.
The initial state isHF,time3/5,and the supplied rational Hamiltonian has six spin
modes/two active electrons. Complete-unit conservation was checked on the full
64-dimensional occupation space before using its invariant nine-dimensional sector.

Finite error comparisons(current/diagonal_prefix/unresolved):
66/0/0.
At physicalepsilon1,the six finite-step comparisons give
6/0/0.
These concern rigorous software intervals for squared infidelity1-|overlap|².
Their strict ordering agrees with1-|overlap|;the numerical error values differ.

The leading-response guard at physicalepsilon1 is **unresolved**.
All eleven guard attempts remain in response_guards.csv,including vacuous cases.
The sufficient coupling-domain result in SUMMARY.json is an algebraic consequence
of the fixed slope bounds and constants;it does not replace any tested failure
or assert the physical Hamiltonian satisfies its leading-response guard.

A separate160-bit Fraction implementation reconstructed literal Pauli actions,
BCH corrections and generic matrix exponentials. Its rigorous state/error
intervals fit inside the producer's192-bit enclosures. One complete extracted
audit covers the byte-identical original payload. Archived Python was never
executed. Analytic tails and arithmetic rounding are separate;approximate states
were not normalized. Every interval and strict/unresolved pair is in the CSVs.

Resource boundaries are retained in EXECUTION_RESOURCES_BEFORE_REPORT.json;
completed reporting usage is recorded separately after this process exits.
Standalone propagation timers exclude reference/unit-operator preparation;
the complete phase receipts include these operations,imports,serialization and
retained failed/repeated preflight work. No timing is a hardware speedup claim.

Input dependency status:verified_actual_merge. Exact details are in SUMMARY.json.
Source review,publication and merge checks are separate gates. Generic Lean work is separate;no concrete molecular
witness or Python interval-arithmetic correctness proof has been checked in Lean.
The certificate concerns supplied exact rational coefficients,with no rigorous
SCF,integral or basis-set error estimate. It establishes no global order optimum,
conservation-only accuracy mechanism,larger-molecule validity or hardware result.
